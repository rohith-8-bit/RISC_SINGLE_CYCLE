# RISC_SINGLE_CYCLE
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a RISC-based single-cycle processor designed from scratch. The processor executes one instruction per clock cycle and supports a subset of the RISC instruction set architecture, including R-type, I-type, branch, and jump instructions.

Anyone using this code can load their instructions onto the memfile.hex and run it on their desired simulator.I have run this code on Icarus Verilog and everything seems to work file.

I am looking to further add more instructions.
