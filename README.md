# RISC_SINGLE_CYCLE
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a RISC-based single-cycle processor designed from scratch. The processor executes one instruction per clock cycle and supports a subset of the RISC instruction set architecture, including R-type, I-type, branch, and jump instructions.
